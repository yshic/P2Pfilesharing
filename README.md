# P2Pfilesharing
A CLI application for easy peer-to-peer file-sharing, this project is part of the assignment for the course Computer Networks.

## Description
- A centralized server keeps track of which clients are connected and storing what files.
- A client informs the server as to what files are contained in its local repository but does not actually transmit file data to the server.
- File-transfering process will occur directly between clients without requiring any server intervention
- Simple command-line interface.
- Support multiple clients downloading different files from a target client simultaneously.
